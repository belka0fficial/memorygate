"""Scored multi-signal memory classifier.

Four memory types: `fact` (durable facts/preferences/identity/humor-style),
`phase` (temporary emotional/circumstantial states - carries a review_by),
`context` (default/fallback, everyday task info), `watch` (behavioral
patterns worth monitoring). This used to be seven finer-grained types
(stable_preference/identity_trait/humor_style -> fact, temporary_phase/
support_context -> phase, task_context -> context, harmful_pattern ->
watch) - the underlying keyword-signal detectors are unchanged from that
version, just aggregated into fewer output buckets.

Each candidate type is defined by one or more independent keyword-list
"signals". A signal fires (contributes weight 1.0) if any phrase in its
list appears in the text - some are gated by an exclusion list instead
(e.g. facts-via-identity-phrase are disqualified by temporary-language
phrasing). The type with the most fired signals wins; ties are broken by
priority order. Confidence scales with how many signals fired: 1 -> low,
2 -> medium, 3+ -> high.
